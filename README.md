# Space Shooter

Port of my Scratch example "game" of same name to Godot 4.4.1

This is not a complete game but rather a project done for learning purposes 

Note I am also just learning Godot so this may not be an ideal implementation, it is intended merely to serve a learning tool for myself on Godot and for my son and others who are interested
to see how a Scratch project may look in Godot.


## Instructions

Simple alien killer done to learn Scratch/Godot

Use arrow keys to move left/right<br/>
Your ship fires once per second automatically<br/>
Asteroids are invincible
